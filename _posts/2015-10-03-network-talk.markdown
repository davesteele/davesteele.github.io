I'm giving a [talk](https://ohiolinux.org/sessions/detecting-characterizing-and-circumventing-network-traffic-restrictions)
today at [Ohio LinuxFest](https://ohiolinux.org/), on investigating network issues for home networks.
The slides are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qShH1xoh1GvMmjGOApN6TWfBq00yE77py_SCazcWAKk/edit?usp=sharing).

It references a number of my packages:
 * [netbwtools](https://github.com/davesteele/netbwtools) - Network bandwidth testing tools, with plottable CSV output
 * [splitcpy](https://github.com/davesteele/splitcpy) - Copy files over the network using multiple parallel SSH streams
 * [mrtg-probes](https://github.com/davesteele/mrtg-probes) - Monitor site download performance in [MRTG](https://oss.oetiker.ch/mrtg/doc/mrtg.en.html)
 * [server-setup-scripts](https://github.com/davesteele/server-setup-scripts) - Server setup scripts (SNMPd)
