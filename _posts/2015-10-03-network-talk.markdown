I'm giving a [talk](https://ohiolinux.org/sessions/detecting-characterizing-and-circumventing-network-traffic-restrictions)
today at [Ohio LinuxFest](https://ohiolinux.org/), on investigating network issues for home networks.
The slides are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qShH1xoh1GvMmjGOApN6TWfBq00yE77py_SCazcWAKk/edit?usp=sharing).
