Here are a few comments I have for my pre-first-Debconf self a month ago.

* Being long past hankering for additional college-type experiences, I opted to skip the dorms, and stayed at a nearby hotel. That was probably a mistake - I think I missed a lot with that choice.
* After checking into dining options in downtown Portland, I also skipped the meal plan. I still think that was the right choice, but ended up eating lunch in the cafeteria a la carte several times, to have more chances to meet and talk.
* With so many people in the same time zone and on the same tasks, I found IRC more useful than usual, particularly the Debconf* channels. A [Quassel](http://quassel-irc.org/) server and [client](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid) may be worth the setup.
* Get [gobby](http://gobby.0x539.de/trac/) installed before your first [BOF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_feather_%28computing%29), and make sure you can access documents on [gobby.debian.org](https://wiki.debian.org/gobby.debian.org).
* Don't take it as a given that your [laptop install](/debian/bugs/2014/09/14/installing_debian_on_an_N2830/) will go smoothly.
